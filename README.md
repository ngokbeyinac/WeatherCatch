# WeatherCatch
This mobile application is developed in SwiftUI. I used OpenWeather API to indicate weather according to user's coordiinates.
Welcome to WeatherCatch! This iOS app provides real-time weather forecasts based on the user's coordinates. It utilizes the OpenWeather API to retrieve accurate and up-to-date weather information.

Features
The WeatherCatch app offers the following features:

Location-Based Weather: The app uses the user's current location coordinates to fetch weather data for that specific location. This ensures that users receive accurate and personalized weather forecasts.

Current Weather: Users can view the current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a brief description of the weather (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy).

Hourly Forecast: WeatherCatch provides an hourly forecast for the next 24 hours, allowing users to plan their activities accordingly. It displays the temperature and weather conditions for each hour.

Daily Forecast: Users can check the weather forecast for the next 7 days. The daily forecast includes the maximum and minimum temperatures, weather description, and an icon representing the weather conditions for each day.
